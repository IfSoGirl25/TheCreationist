ProjectVoid.TheCreationist
==========================

TheCreationist (THEC) is an Open Source ASCII to ANSI converter which translates coloured text to escape sequences which can then be used on TinyMUX platforms. The codes are parsed by the TinyMUX engine to display both foreground and background colours to the MU* Client.

With the introduction of 8-bit colour in MUX 2.10, previous tools that have been used such as A2A (created by PhantomProductions) no longer support the full range of colours. TheCreationist not only supports the new variety of colours, but seeks to provide new and improved aspects of functionality, too.

Features
========
TheCreationist has a variety of unique features that assist with creating ASCII and ANSI art for the TinyMUX platform. These include:

- Support for 8-Bit colour in hexadecimal format escape sequences.
- Favourite swatches can be saved persistently between sessions.
- Swatch Analyzer enables checking previously utilized colours.
- Enable/disable spellcheck to review project quality as desired.
- Variable font size and colour for easier readability.
- Configurable repository for easier access to projects.
