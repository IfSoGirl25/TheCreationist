ProjectVoid.TheCreationist
==========================

TheCreationist (THEC) is an ASCII to ANSI converter which translates coloured text to escape sequences which can then be used on TinyMUX platforms. The codes are parsed by the TinyMUX engine to display both foreground and background colours to the MU* Client.
