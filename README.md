TheCreationist
==========================

TheCreationist is an Open Source application which helps convert coloured ASCII to custom escape sequences for TinyMUX (http://www.tinymux.org/) platforms.

With the introduction of 8-bit colour in MUX 2.10, previous tools that have been used such as A2A (created by PhantomProductions) no longer support the range of colours available. TheCreationist not only supports the new variety of colours, but seeks to provide new and improved aspects of functionality.

To download the latest available release, please follow this link: https://github.com/wyrdathru/TheCreationist/releases

Features
========

- Conversion and compilation to and from TinyMUX-compatible soft codes
- Multiple project support for increased productivity in a single instance
- Organization of color swatches into libraries for task-specific grouping

Third Party Dependencies
===================

I would like to thank the following projects and their authors for making much of what I've done possible through their hard work:

- MahApps.Metro (http://mahapps.com/) has been used to implement Windows 8 (Metro) styling in TheCreationist.
- MVVM Light Toolkit (http://www.galasoft.ch/mvvm) has been used to implement the MVVM design pattern in TheCreationst.
- Windows (Metro) Icons (http://icons8.com/) has been used to supply the icons for TheCreationist.
- Palette Icon (http://www.doublejdesign.co.uk/) has been used as the application icon.
